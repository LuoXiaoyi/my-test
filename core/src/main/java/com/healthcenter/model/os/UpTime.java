 * /proc/uptime
 *      This  file  contains two numbers: the uptime of the system (seconds), and the amount of time spent in
 *      idle process (seconds).
 *
 * /proc/loadavg
 *               The first three fields in this file are load average figures giving the number of  jobs  in  the  run
 *               queue  (state  R) or waiting for disk I/O (state D) averaged over 1, 5, and 15 minutes.  They are the
 *               same as the load average numbers given by uptime(1) and other programs.  The fourth field consists of
 *               two  numbers separated by a slash (/).  The first of these is the number of currently runnable kernel
 *               scheduling entities (processes, threads).  The value after the slash is the number of kernel schedul‚Äê
 *               ing  entities that currently exist on the system.  The fifth field is the PID of the process that was
 *               most recently created on the system.
